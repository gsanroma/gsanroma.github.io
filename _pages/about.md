I am interested in the application of Data Science and Computer Vision techniques to a variety of domains, especially lately in the Health Sciences.
During my Ph.D, I combined Bayesian modelling and multiple-view geometry for object detection and image matching.
Afterwards, I undertook a safety \& security project with the [Intelligent Imaging group at TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-areas/defence-safety-security/expertise-groups/intelligent-imaging/), where I used state-space models and stochastic grammars to automatically recognize threats from video feeds.
I currently focus on the analysis of Neuroimaging for the Health Sciences.
I applied a variety of machine learning techniques for brain MRI segmentation with the [IDEA group at UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup/).
Afterwards, I was awarded a [Marie-Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) to analyze fetal neurodevelopment using advanced morphometric measures and machine learning techniques.
This project was done in collaboration with clinical researchers from the [Fetal Medicine Research Center (Barcelona)](http://medicinafetalbarcelona.org/).
I am currently with the [Population Health Sciences at DZNE](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/population-health-sciences/), where I am involved in the coordination of the MRI group of the Rhineland Study, a population study to investigate the determinants of neurodegenerative diseases.
