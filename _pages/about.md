I am interested in the application of Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques to a variety of domains, lately in the Health Sciences.
During my Ph.D, I combined Bayesian modelling and multiple-view geometry for object detection and image matching.
Afterwards, I undertook a safety & security project with the [Intelligent Imaging group at TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-areas/defence-safety-security/expertise-groups/intelligent-imaging/), where I used state-space models and stochastic grammars to automatically recognize threats from video feeds.
I currently focus on the analysis of Neuroimaging for the Health Sciences.
I applied a variety of machine learning techniques for brain MRI segmentation with the [IDEA group at UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup/).
Afterwards, I was awarded a [Marie-Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) to analyze fetal neurodevelopment using advanced morphometric measures and machine learning techniques.
This project was a collaboration between my previous group [BCN MedTech](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/) and the [Fetal Medicine Research Center](http://medicinafetalbarcelona.org/).
I am currently with the [Population Health Sciences at DZNE](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/population-health-sciences/), where I am involved in the coordination of the MRI group of the [Rhineland Study](https://www.rheinland-studie.de/), a population study to investigate the determinants of neurodegenerative diseases.
