I obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in 2008 and 2012 from Universitat Rovira i Virgili (Tarragona, Spain). In my thesis I extracted graphs from images and found correspondences between them using Bayesian modelling. With the correspondences, I exploited geometrical relationships between multiple images to discover objects

In 2012, I joined the Intelligent Imaging group at the Dutch research institute TNO (The Hague netherlands). I developed a method for the automatic detection of threats from a video feed. This was part of an European project for the security sector. This project involved a consortium composed of both Universities and Companies.

In 2013, I joined IDEA group in University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (United States usa), where I explored machine learning techniques such as low-rank matrix completion and support-vector machines for analyzing brain MRI.

In 2015, I was awarded a Marie Curie fellowship and joined Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona). I developed general methods for brain MRI analysis that could handle different age groups such as fetuses and adults. As part of this project, I supervised the Ph.D. thesis of Dr. Oualid M. Benkarim and collaborated with clinical researchers at the Hospital Clinic (Barcelona). The clinical application consisted in finding imaging markers of abnormal brain development in fetuses with a pathology named Isolated Mild Ventriculomegaly. I also supervise the Ph.D thesis of Gerard Marti Juan in the framework of a collaboration with Alzeihmer researchers in the Alfa project, a cohort study within the Pasqual Maragall Foundation (Barcelona). We aim at finding hippocampal atrophy patterns consistent with the ApoE4 genotype.

Since October 2017, I am with the Population Siences group led by M. Breteler at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE, Germany). I am involved in the coordination of the MRI group of the Rhineland Study, a population study to investigate the determinants of neurodegenerative diseases. My tasks include oversee all the steps in the MRI flow: acquisition, data management, computational resources and image processing / analysis. These tasks involve collaboration with imaging physicists, epidemiologists, IT-experts and image analysis experts
I develop image analysis pipelines to automatically detect lesions and anatomical structures in the brain. These provide measures of brain pathology and allow to identify potential determinants (eg., age, diet, hypertension, ...) at early life stages
I also develop machine learning techniques to unravel pathological processes in the brain.
