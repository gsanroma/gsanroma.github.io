I am all about extracting meaning from Data, be it detecting objects from images or finding disease biomarkers. I have a strong scientific record in applied Machine Learning. I am technically fluent with different Big Data types: images, biological and video. I have experience managing small teams and enjoy collaborating in multidisciplinary environments. I love to create value through data-driven solutions and pay attention to all the steps: data collection, curation, modelling, validation and visualization.
