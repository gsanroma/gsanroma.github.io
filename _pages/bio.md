I have a track record of applied machine learning and computer vision.
My areas of interest include neuroimaging, population sciences and defence.

Professional trajectory:
- phd on multiple-view geometry for object detection and image matching at [DEIM-URV](http://deim.urv.cat/)
- automatic threat recognition from video with [intelligent imaging at TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-areas/defence-safety-security/expertise-groups/intelligent-imaging/)
- brain MRI segmentation with [IDEA at UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup/)
- [Marie-Curie fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) with [BCN-MedTech](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/) to analyze 1) fetal neurodevelopment and 2) neurodegeneration. Both projects are collaborations with [fetal medicine research center](http://medicinafetalbarcelona.org/) and [Pasqual Maragall foundation](https://fpmaragall.org/en/), respectively
- analysis of brain MRI in the [Rhineland Study](https://www.rheinland-studie.de/), a population study with [DZNE](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/population-health-sciences/) to investigate the determinants of neurodegenerative diseases
