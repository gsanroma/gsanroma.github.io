Work experience
======
* 2017-Present: Research Fellow at the [German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)](https://www.dzne.de/)
  - I am involved in the organization of the MRI group in the [Rhineland Study](https://www.rheinland-studie.de/). My tasks include oversee all the steps in the MRI flow: acquisition, data management, computational resources and image processing / analysis. These tasks involve collaboration with imaging physicists, epidemiologists, IT-experts and image analysis experts
  - Develop image analysis pipelines to automatically detect lesions and anatomical structures in the brain
  - Develop machine learning techniques to unravel pathological processes in the brain

* 2015-2017: Marie-Curie Research Fellow at [BCN MedTech](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/)
  - I was awarded a Marie Curie fellowship to develop general methods for brain MRI analysis that could handle different age groups such as fetuses and adults. As part of this project, I supervised the Ph.D. thesis of Dr. Oualid M. Benkarim and collaborated with clinical researchers at the the [Fetal Medicine Research Center](http://medicinafetalbarcelona.org/). We aimed at finding imaging markers of abnormal brain development in fetuses with Isolated Mild Ventriculomegaly
  - I also supervise the Ph.D thesis of Gerard Mart\'i Juan in the framework of a collaboration with Alzeihmer researchers in the [Alfa Study](https://fpmaragall.org/en/research-alzheimer/alfa-study-against-alzheimer/). We aim at finding hippocampal atrophy patterns consistent with the ApoE4 genotype

* 2013-2015: Research Fellow at [IDEA group at UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup/)
  - I developed brain MRI segmentation algorithms using machine learning techniques including low-rank matrix completion and support-vector machines

* 2012-2013: Research Fellow at the [Intelligent Imaging group at TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-areas/defence-safety-security/expertise-groups/intelligent-imaging/)
  - I developed a method for the automatic detection of threats from a video feed. This was part of [ARENA](http://www.arena-fp7.eu/), an EU project for the Security & Defence sector
