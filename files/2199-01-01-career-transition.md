I am very excited to soon start an industry position after the end of my post-doc period.
In this post I want to share my experience and give tips to people in a similar situation thinking as well on changing to industry.

As a bit of background, I have a MSc and PhD in computer science. The following 7 years after my PhD I have spent as post-doc in several labs working in the fields of computer vision, neuroimaging and machine learning.

Why I have decided to go to industry ?
One reason is the lack of long-term perspectives in academia. The reality is there are only a few permanent positions compared to the amount of candidadtes. I cannot say this comes as a surprise, but this lack of long-term perspective its been increasingly bothering me with the time. Especially with family, one is not very keen on chasing post-doc positions across different universities and possibly across countries as well.
Adding to that, it is still not clear to me whether alternative career paths are possible beyond leading a research group or teaching, for example a more technical path. They say there are staff scientist positions in some public institutes, but these are like unicorns to me.

I believe the PhD and post-doc communities would greatly benefit from exposure to a range of career options inside and outside of academia.
I believe the same research institutes should facilitate this exposure through career advise centers. Otherwise, it is easy to get isolated doing the own work and lose sight of other options.

The goal of this post is to give advice for those who decide to switch from academia to industry by explaining what I went through and what I found important.
The first step is identifying the types of positions that you would like to work in and look at job offers in apps like glassdoor and linkedin.
It is good to be creative at this step and include different roles where you think you would fit. In my case this would for example be: computer vision, machine learning, medical imaging, data science.
Already by reading the job descriptions, one learns what skills are required for each type of position and can get a sense of whether you like it and would be able to do it.
I find it is not necessary that one meets all the requirements but one should meet a reasonable minimum, say 70%, in order to have chances.
It is also interesting to look for the companies ratings in terms of employee satisfaction. Some job-portals like Glassdor include this feature. Other portals like kununu are exclusively dedicated to this.

The next step is to apply for the offers that you feel most excited about.
This usually involves sending a CV + a cover letter.

### CV & cover letter

In my opinion, the most important parts in the CV are the professional experience, education and skills/tools.
- professional experience: for each position include the name of the position and a couple of bullet points with the most important tasks.
As for the name of the position, I prefer to use **research staff scientist** rather than post-doc.
As for the description of tasks, it is important to highlight the results obtained. I like the Sandwitch rule in the _Resume Guide_ at [Cheeky Scientist](https://cheekyscientist.com/) to write the tasks. According to this rule, each task should _sandwich_ a technical skill (the technical role on the task) between a transferable skill (more on that later) and a quantifiable result.
I find it is not necessary to write all the tasks using this pattern. It may be too repetitive and also it may result awkward for some tasks, but I recommend using it in some of the tasks.
- education: nothing more and nothing less than the education titles
- skills / tools: List your technical skills (ie, tools and techniques you have experience with), including the number of years of experience for each.
List also your transferrable skills. These are things outside your technical competences. Highlight results, if possible.
The transferable skills 


It is important that you highlight the skills and tools. Also focus on results.
They do not want to see an exhaustive list of papers although I find it is not bad to include some as proof of result of some of your professional experience.
I find useful the guide in cheeky scientist

Typically in a CV you put your experience, education and skills.
Skills are things like communication, 
First is CV. Put experience and soft skills.
In experience you want soft skills, technical skills and results. This I learned from cheekyscientist.
In skills put skills you want to highlight.
I like to put a line on hobbys. I always get asked about that and helps relax discussion and show a bit about person.
Really not so much more. There are not fixed rules. It is really about showing experience and skills that match the work. Use the buzzwords. **this is a link to my CV**

Cover letter. Personalize the cover letter for the job. Ellaborate in the experience and soft skills that are more relevant for the job. Explain what you like about the job you apply and why you think you would be a good match.

It is also good to know your values. This helps identify the preferences that you look in a type of work. (**put list**)

What are your strengths / soft-skills. In industry this is very important you have to bring across these. check cheekyscientist

Hopefully, you will land several interviews.
These are for convincing them that you are the right one but also for you to learn more about the company and whether you will like the kind of job.

### interview

Then interview.
Some advise in any kind of interview either telephone or presential.

1. Prepare well why you want to change. This will get asked for sure. Be honest. Put it in a way that highlights the benefit that they will get in getting you. Use your strengths and values that highlights how the applied for job suits for you.
2. Another question you have to expect is why this specific company. Prepare explanation why you are interested in the company and how line of work and values align with you.
3. Prepare some questions that help you know what you will be doing.
4. Important to prepare for HR questions. These are questions about how reacted in different situations or about personality. Examples of questions I've been asked:
- examples when I convinced others of something
- when I did something wrong and what did I learn
- an unreasonable customer request
- example of a very challenging project I worked on
- what things make me angry
- things do not like about my interpersonal skills

It may seem not but it is important to answer these questions (usually 1 or 2). 
It is recommendable to answer something, otherwise gives the impression that you do not have enough baggage and have not been confronted with situations.
When answering it is recommendable to put them in a light that it reflects actually something good. For example what makes you angry: when somebody looks down on somebody else for asking a "silly" question (this shows empathy and that you promote asking questions). Things that do not like about my interpersonal skills: I am too impatient.

Have more or less clear strenghts and values to apply matching jobs. For example if not interested in leadership skills do not apply to leadership roles because you will get asked a lot of leadership questions for which you may not have good answers.

## wrap-up

I hope this is helpful advise to people in the process of transition from academia to industry (or just looking for an industry job).
For people that is in academia, I think that this is good times to go to industry if you like applied thing. A lot of things happening right now in computer science at a high pace.
It is some work to put all your things together and can be emotionally tiring because it exposes you to rejections.
But afterall this is a process of deciding what you want to do and helps you grow.
No matter where you are, it is important to continue growing and developing.
