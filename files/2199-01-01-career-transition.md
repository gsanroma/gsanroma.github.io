I am very excited to soon start an industry position after the end of my post-doc period.
In this post I want to share my experience and give tips to people in a similar situation thinking as well on changing to industry.

As a bit of background, I have a MSc and PhD in computer science. The following 7 years after my PhD I have spent as post-doc in several labs working in the fields of computer vision, neuroimaging and machine learning.

Why I have decided to go to industry ?
One reason is the lack of long-term perspectives in academia. The reality is there are only a few permanent positions compared to the amount of candidadtes. I cannot say this comes as a surprise, but this lack of long-term perspective its been increasingly bothering me with the time. Especially with family, one is not very keen on chasing post-doc positions across different universities and possibly across countries as well.
Adding to that, it is still not clear to me whether alternative career paths are possible beyond leading a research group or teaching, for example a more technical path. They say there are staff scientist positions in some public institutes, but these type of positions are like unicorns to me.

I believe the PhD and post-doc communities would greatly benefit from exposure to a range of career options inside and outside of academia.
I believe the same research institutes should facilitate this exposure through career advise centers. Otherwise, it is easy to get isolated doing the own work and lose sight of other options.

The goal of this post is to give advice for those who decide to switch from academia to industry by explaining what I went through and what I found important.
The first step is identifying the types of positions that you would like to work in and look at job offers in apps like glassdoor and linkedin.
It is good to be creative at this step and include different roles where you think you would fit. In my case this would for example be: computer vision, machine learning, medical imaging, data science.
Already by reading the job descriptions, one learns what skills are required for each type of position and can get a sense of whether you like it and would be able to do it.
I find it is not necessary that one meets all the requirements but one should meet a reasonable minimum, say 70%, in order to have chances.
I like to look at the employee satisfaction ratings for the companies. Some job-portals like Glassdor include this feature. Other portals like kununu are exclusively dedicated to this.

The next step is to apply for the offers that you feel most excited about.
This usually involves sending a Resume + a cover letter.

### Resume 

The Resume shows what you have achieved (professional experience and education) and what you are capable of doing in more general terms (skills).
Additional sections may include hobbies, trainings/courses, languages, ...
- professional experience: for each position include the name of the position and your most notable accomplishments.
I like to use **research staff associate** as a name for post-doc positions.
As for the accomplishments, I like the Sandwitch rule in the _Resume Guide_ at [Cheeky Scientist](https://cheekyscientist.com/). For each entry, you should _sandwich_ a technical skill between a transferable skill (more on that later) and a quantifiable result. 
I find it is not necessary to write _all_ the entries using this rule but I like because it conveys 3 important pieces of information. 
- education: really nothing much to add. A list of academic titles, University names and years of study.
- skills: this shows what you can do and is especially important when changing job fields or sectors (eg, from academia to industry) because it shows how your previous experience may be leveraged in your future role. This typically includes technical skills (tools and techniques that you know) and transferrable skills (more general skills like communication, leadership, ...). If possible include years of experience in each skill. You may also quantify your skills with some result. 
You can find guides of transferrable skills on the internet to use as guide. There's also one at [Cheeky Scientist](https://cheekyscientist.com/).

**Others**:

I like to start the Resume with a general statement about my professional aims.
I also like to include a line or two on hobbies. During interviews, I've got asked about that a couple of times and find that distends the atmosphere.

Contrary to an application for a post-doc position, industry recruiters are not looking for an exhaustive list of publications.
However, you may include the most important ones, preferably as a quantifiable result of your professional experience or skills.

As for the layout, be concise in the content and allow for generous white spaces (lateral margins, section separations, ...).
Making it visually appealing might maximize the chances of getting it actually reviewed.
Use buzzwords that match with the ones in the job description (in my case these could be: computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, Python, etc...). 
Regarding a personal photo, I think that it does not add anything to the Resume and it may actually harm more than benefit, so I don't use it.
The Resume should not be more than 2 pages in length (ideally 1 for recent PhD graduates).

[Here](files/sanroma_resume.pdf) is my Resume as an example.

### cover letter

In the cover letter, you explain the story about why you are the ideal candidate for the job.
You ellaborate on your most relevant experience and skills for the job.
You also motivate why you want this job at this company specifically.
The cover letter is tailored for a specific job application (contrary to the Resume, which you may leave practically unchanged for different applications within same field).

As for the style and formatting, I personally like concise cover letters (less than 1 page) organized in 3 or 4 different paragraphs.
Proofread to make sure there are no typos.

### submitting your application

Submission goes usually through the company site. 
Some positions receive a lot of applications and may be that your application is not reviewed properly. 
That is why it is important that your package looks applealing at first sight (ie neat, concise, with Buzzwords and without typos).
If you know somebody in the company (eg, through linkedin) it is good that you tell them about your application. It stands more chances of getting reviewed. But this is definitely not a must.
An alternative to directly submitting your application is to go through professional recruiters. The same recruiter may be responsible for several positions in diffrent companies. 
The good thing about recruiters is that they have direct contact with the company, so that they can get feedback from the status of your application.
Also, they know the details about the position and help you prepare your application because they are also interested in that you get hired.
Linkedin profiles include an option to signal to recruiters that you are open to offers. For that, you need an updated Linkedin profile.
I found this is a quite effective way to get approached. It is also not publicly signaled, so that only recruiters know that you are looking for a job.

Also, if you apply early your chances that the application gets reviewed are higher.

Do not worry too much about rejections at this stage. Luckily the job landscape is wide and you can apply to other jobs.
Hopefully, you will land several interviews.
These are for convincing them that you are the right one but also for you to learn more about the company and whether you will like the kind of job.

### interview

It is also good to know your values. This helps identify the preferences that you look in a type of work. (**put list**)

Then interview.
Some advise in any kind of interview either telephone or presential.

1. Prepare well why you want to change. This will get asked for sure. Be honest. Put it in a way that highlights the benefit that they will get in getting you. Use your strengths and values that highlights how the applied for job suits for you.
2. Another question you have to expect is why this specific company. Prepare explanation why you are interested in the company and how line of work and values align with you.
3. Prepare some questions that help you know what you will be doing.
4. Important to prepare for HR questions. These are questions about how reacted in different situations or about personality. Examples of questions I've been asked:
- examples when I convinced others of something
- when I did something wrong and what did I learn
- an unreasonable customer request
- example of a very challenging project I worked on
- what things make me angry
- things do not like about my interpersonal skills

It may seem not but it is important to answer these questions (usually 1 or 2). 
It is recommendable to answer something, otherwise gives the impression that you do not have enough baggage and have not been confronted with situations.
When answering it is recommendable to put them in a light that it reflects actually something good. For example what makes you angry: when somebody looks down on somebody else for asking a "silly" question (this shows empathy and that you promote asking questions). Things that do not like about my interpersonal skills: I am too impatient.

Have more or less clear strenghts and values to apply matching jobs. For example if not interested in leadership skills do not apply to leadership roles because you will get asked a lot of leadership questions for which you may not have good answers.

## wrap-up

I hope this is helpful advise to people in the process of transition from academia to industry (or just looking for an industry job).
For people that is in academia, I think that this is good times to go to industry if you like applied thing. A lot of things happening right now in computer science at a high pace.
It is some work to put all your things together and can be emotionally tiring because it exposes you to rejections.
But afterall this is a process of deciding what you want to do and helps you grow.
No matter where you are, it is important to continue growing and developing.
